# Front-End React Assignment

## Overview

In this assignment, I have created an application that displays articles.

## Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the root div and script to load the React app.
- `src/main.tsx`: The entry point of the React application.
- `src/App.tsx`: The main App component that handles routing and displays articles.
- `src/api/articles.ts`: API functions to fetch articles from the backend.
- `src/components/ArticleCard.tsx`: Component to display a summary of an article.
- `src/components/ArticleDetail.tsx`: Component to display detailed information about an article.
- `src/types/article.ts`: TypeScript types for the Article object.

## Requirements

1. The application is made with React and TypeScript.
2. There is a front page that shows all the available articles. From this page, it is possible to open any article to view its full text.
3. Implemented state management to handle the rendering of articles.
4. Implemented error handling for cases such as failed data fetching or rendering issues.
